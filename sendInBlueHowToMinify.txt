Paste human readable code into SendInBlue's Paste Your Code editor, and save.  Then edit the email content. A textarea will open with the code still not minified. Inspect the textarea element with your browser, and copy the element.  Save the element code to an HTML file in Dreamweaver. View the HTML file in Design view. It should look like minified code without syntax highlighting. While in design view, escape any < or > that you intend to be text in the email and not code.   There are two such in the block of the email advertising LaRouche's writings. (Read more here >> ).  Replace the >> with &gt;&gt; in Design view. Be patient! Next, Copy the text in Design View, return to Code view, and paste the text in Code View, and save.  Copy the code in code view, which should be minified and error-free, into SendInBlue's PYC editor.
