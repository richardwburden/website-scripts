View commits, latest first:

git log

To commit changes in GitShell:

git commit -a

to edit the last commit's message (does not bring up editor; must copy and paste into command line)

git commit --amend -m "New and correct message"

to copy your local repository to the remote, enter the following in GitShell:

git push --mirror https://github.com/richardwburden/website-scripts
git push --mirror https://github.com/richardwburden/new_daybook

changes since last commit:
git diff --cached

Note that git diff displays the diffs with something like the less reader utility.  Navigate through the listing with PageUp and PageDown keys.  Type q to exit.

for a dry run, use the --dry-run parameter


to view a previous version of a file, use git log to find the commit number, then

git show commit_number:path_to_file   

where path_to_file uses forward slashes and is relative to the current working directory.

the output of git show can be written to a file so it can be viewed in an editor of your choice (be careful not to overwrite the current version of the file):

git show commit_number:path_to_file > temp.pl


to view changes since an arbitrary commit:
git diff <commit> [<path>]
